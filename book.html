            Since the first day we met, we both have no idea how good friends we will become. Talking to you for the first time in lockdown didn't make me feel as if I would never talk to you again. Because I feel like I don't match your standards.<br>I had a strong crush on you at college time but that time I feel that I am an asshole and not good for you and I was sacred that day. Fear of your anger.<br>
            But as time progressed, our conversations started happening on WhatsApp. We become a crazy friends.

            There‚Äôs this charm, a beauty that‚Äôs hard to describe. From the
            sparkle in your eyes to the warmth in your smile, everything about
            you seems flawless. Honestly, sometimes it feels like you were
            created as a masterpiece, carefully designed to brighten the world.

            Talking to you has quickly become one of my favorite parts of the
            day. Every time I see a message from you, I can't help but smile. It
            feels like my day instantly gets brighter just because of our
            conversation. You're not just great to look at; your personality
            makes you even more special.

            Here, I'm not purposing you or not trying to impress you. I just want to say that I am very lucky to have you in my life as a best friend and as a special friend.<br> Only you are the one who can I share my saddness as well as my happiness. I don't know which place is my mine in your life. I thought you have lots of male friends some of that should be special. But in my life, since my childhood I had lots of female friends but no one is like you.
